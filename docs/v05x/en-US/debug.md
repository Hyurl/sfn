<!-- title: Debug In IDE; order: 7.1 -->

# Concept

During development phase, using an IDE to debug the application is recommended.
SFN supports many ways to debug, and the configuration is very easy to set.

# Debug In Visual Studio Code

### Setup Configuration

SFN provides a simple scheme to debug in **Visual Studio Code**. If you've just 
installed the framework, and you have a `.vscode` folder under your project 
directory, the framework will automatically generate a debug configuration file 
`launch.json` for you. But if such a filename already exists, or `.vscode` isn't
there, then no generation operation will be performed. You may create this file 
yourself, or just click the button **Debug** >> **Open Configurations**, the 
editor will automatically generate the template file used for debugging. All you
have to do is just configure it just like the following, and it's ready to debug.

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "protocol": "auto",
            "name": "Launch the Server",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/dist/index"
        }
    ]
}
```

Visual Studio Code debugger has built-in support for TypeScript, so you can 
directly set breakpoints in the source files, all these things, is just like 
debugging a pure JavaScript project.

# Debug In WebStorm

### Setup Configuration

It is also easy to configure debugger for SFN in WebStorm, which has build-in 
support for TypeScript as well. First open your project directory in a WebStorm 
window, click the button **Run** on the top menu, and select 
**Add/Edit Configuration** item, a configuration window will self-popup.

Click the plus sign **+** button at top-left, choose item **Node.js**, and you will be 
asked for inputting detail of the project, select the **Working directory**
and **JavaScript file** as shown below, click **OK**, and it's done.

### Auto-Compile TypeScript

You may also want to auto-compile your project if you're coding in TypeScript, 
just do the following steps:

<img src="/images/webstorm-debug-compile.png" style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top"/>

<img src="/images/webstorm-debug-compile2.png" style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top"/>

### Start Debugging The Application

Once setup, you can now click the **Debug** button at the top-right corner in 
the window:

<img src="/images/webstorm-debug2.png"/>

And you'll be seeing this console that says application successfully started in 
debug mode:

### Set And Hit Breakpoints

You can set breakpoints in a source file, then open your browser visiting a link
that will definitely hit it, and you will be seeing the result similar to this 
in your editor:

<img src="/images/webstorm-debug4.png"/>

And on the bottom, you will see the debug console activated (don't forget to 
click the **continue** button so your program won't hang still):

# Debug in Visual Studio 2017

Debugging JavaScript/TypeScript project in Visual Studio is easy, you just have 
to set the entry file `dist/index.js` as **Startup Item** in
**Solution Explorer**, just like this:

<img src="/images/vs-debug.png"/>

And you will be able to debug the application by clicking the debug button on 
the top menu:

<img src="/images/vs-debug-button.png"/>

Visual Studio debugger behave a little different than VS Code or WebStorm, when
debugging, a new console window will be open. Except that, other operations are 
almost the same, and you can set breakpoints directly in the TypeScript source 
code.

In the bottom panel, you can watch call stack, breakpoints, etc.
