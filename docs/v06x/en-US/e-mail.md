# Concept

Since v0.6, it is recommended that the developer should implement his own mail
service and runs as micro-service. You can have a look at the
[sfn-mail](https://github.com/hyurl/sfn-mail) wrapper for
[NodeMailer](https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer), in case you want to
implement you own mail service.
