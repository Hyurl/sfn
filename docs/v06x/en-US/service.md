# Concept

In a distributed system, **Service** is the most basic and most important 
concept. With the RPC ability that [Alar](https://github.com/hyurl/alar) 
framework gives, SFN provides the simplest however efficient development scheme 
of distributed service. During the development process, you will scarcely notice 
that you're working on a distributed system, every development task could be 
done on a single machine, and when deploy, it is very easy to separate services, to run them distributed.


## Create a New Service

Write a new service file, store it under `src/services/` directory, ensure the 
filename consists with the variable name under the namespace. Let's look at this
simple cache service example bellow.

(NOTE: `ModuleProxy` is a global interface from Alar framework, no need to 
import, just use it directly.)

```typescript
// src/services/cache.ts
import * as fs from "fs-extra";
import get = require("lodash/get");
import has = require("lodash/has");
import set = require("lodash/set");
import unset = require("lodash/unset");

declare global {
    namespace app {
        namespace services {
            const cache: ModuleProxy<CacheService>;
        }
    }
}

export default class CacheService {
    protected cache: { [path: string]: any } = {};
    protected filename = app.ROOT_PATH + "/cache/cache-service.json";

    async init() {
        try {
            let data = await fs.readFile(this.filename, "utf8");
            this.cache = JSON.parse(data);
        } catch (e) { }
    }

    async destroy() {
        let data = JSON.stringify(this.cache);
        await fs.writeFile(this.filename, data, "utf8");
    }

    async get<T>(path: string) {
        return get(this.cache, path);
    }

    async has(path: string) {
        return has(this.cache, path);
    }

    async set<T>(path: string, data: T) {
        return set(this.cache, path, data);
    }

    async delete(path: string) {
        return unset(this.cache, path);
    }
}
```

And then wherever you need, use namespace to access the instance of this service.

```typescript
(async () => {
    await app.services.cache("some route").set("something", "This is a test");
    // ...
})();
```

website.

## Distributed Services

The framework [Alar](https://github.com/hyurl/alar) that SFN uses allows 
services being separated and called as RPC procedures, so that to reduce the 
pressure of the web server, and improve the stability. This mechanism is also 
used to easily build a distributed service system.

To separate the services, you just need to do some simple configurations.

```typescript
// src/config.ts
export default <app.Config>{
    server: {
        rpc: {
            "cache-server": {
                host: "localhost",
                port: 4004,
                services: [app.services.cache]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Compile the program and use the following command to start the new server.

```sh
node dist cache-server
```

## Service Dependencies

After start the cache service via the above command, the web server (including 
HTTP and WebSocket) will be able to redirect all traffics to this service to
the new server, basically you don't have to alter any code (BUT remember not all
properties are supported, and the methods will all become asynchronous).

However if you want another service running in another RPC server to be able to
access this service, then you need to config service dependencies for that RPC
server, just like this:

```typescript
// src/config.ts
export default <app.Config>{
    server: {
        rpc: {
            "doc-server": {
                host: "localhost",
                port: 4001,
                services: [app.services.docs],
                dependencies: [app.services.cache]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Then all programs runs in doc-server, when calling `app.services.cache`, will be
able to redirect all their traffics to the server that ships this service (no
matter how many servers are configured to ship the cache service).

The different designs between web server and RPC server, are because, usually,
the web server requires more back-end services (especially for web applications).
And an RPC service will less likely rely on another RPC service, usually only
few functions are required. Of course, if you do not know which service might be
needed or not, you can directly set `dependencies` property to `all`, in order 
to connect all RPC services.

## Basic Service

For convenience, the framework integrated with a basic `Service` class, which
contains some useful methods, e.g. `i18n`, `throttle`, `queue`. The developer
can use them to achieve relevant functions, just inherit this service when
creating a new service.

```ts
import { Service } from "sfn";

export default class MyService extends Service {
    throttledOps(...args: any[]) {
        return this.throttle("a unique key", async () => {
            return this.i18n("This method can only be called once for every second");
        }, 1000);
    }

    queuedOps(...args: any[]) {
        return this.queue("a unique key", async () => {
            return this.i18n("All calls to this method will be queued up");
        });
    }
}
```

In fact, HTTP controller and WebSocket controller are also base on this basic 
service, which will be mentioned afterwards.

## Service Initiation and Destruction

SFN v0.6 ships with Alar v6, which provides the ability to support life cycle
controls of the service. When running distributed, if a service has an `init()`
method, then it will be invoked on the start-up, in order to perform initiation
for the serviceï¼Œ for example, connecting to a database. BUT it should be aware
that this feature only works with the services that was served as RPC services.

Just like the initiation, if a service has a `destroy()` method, it will be
called when the system shuts down, in order to release resources, do garbage
collection, etc.

The basic `Service` class already includes these methods, in order to perform
some elementary tasks, for instance, the auto garbage collection for internal
data. If an extended class wish needs to override these methods, it should call
the parent method inside the new method.

```ts
import { Service } from "sfn";

export default class MyService extends Service {
    async init() {
        await super.init();
        // ...
    }

    async destroy() {
        await super.destroy();
        // ...
    }
}
```

## Customize Garbage Collection

As pointed out above, the basic `Service` class contains an internal garbage
collector, and of course an extended class can use and extend this method to
clean custom data periodically. To do so, just override the `gc()` method like
this:

```ts
import { Service } from "sfn";

export default class MyService extends Service {
    protected async gc() {
        super.gc(); // make sure the parent's gc is applied.
        // ...
    }
}
```

The timing of invoking `gc()` is decided by an internal timer, however, when
`destroy()` is called, the `gc()` will always be called alongside.
