<!-- title: ORM Model; order: 5 -->
# Tip
History versions of SFN used [Modelar](https://github.com/hyurl/modelar) as its
default ORM system, however, due to some issues happened during practices, and
it restricted the usage of other ORM systems or the MongoDB, so since v0.6, SFN
removed all bindings with Modelar, and encourages users to port their desired 
ORM systems.
